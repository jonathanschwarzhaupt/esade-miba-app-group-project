# Educational Geometry pygame

When prompted with the possibility to create our own project, a lot of ideas emerge.  During our brainstorming, some of us remembered a programme which we used in school to calculate shape areas and more complex calculations. Given our level of expertise, we thought of replicating such application, in a simpler ver-sion. Therefore, the goal is to provide a simple educational tool which calculates the area of four geometrical shapes and display the uses formula to the user.

From a user perspective, the programme is straight forward: users are given to choose amongst four 2D shapes, namely a square, a rectangle, a cone, or a circle. Upon selection, they will be prompted to enter the required dimensions, and by pressing a button “calculate” will be returned the area. Although this pro-gramme appears simple, it has allowed us to implement OOP concepts, such as Classes, Attributes & Inheritance.
